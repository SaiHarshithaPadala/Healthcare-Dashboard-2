# Healthcare-Dashboard-2
# 🏥 Emergency Room Visits Analysis Dashboard (Tableau)

An interactive and data-driven **Tableau dashboard** that analyzes synthetic emergency room (ER) visit data to uncover patient utilization trends, department referrals, wait times, and satisfaction levels. Built using publicly available **synthetic EHR data** generated via **Synthea**, this project showcases how healthcare systems can use BI tools to optimize ER operations, improve patient experience, and track equity across demographics.
